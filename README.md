# Supermarket Sales Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict supermarket sales using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and building predictive models. The models used include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting classifiers.

## Features

- Data loading and initial exploration
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and relationships
- Visualization of data using scatter plots, box plots, pair plots, etc.
- Model building: training and evaluating KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting classifiers
- Model evaluation using classification reports, confusion matrices, and training scores

## File Structure

- `main.py`: Python script containing the entire code for analysis, visualization, and model building.
- `supermarket-sales.csv`: Dataset containing supermarket sales data.
- `cast.png`: WordCloud image generated from the "Product line" column.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- wordcloud

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the `main.py` script using Python:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
